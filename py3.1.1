Write a python program to input the sides of a triangle and check whether the triangle is valid or not.

Note: A
 triangle is valid if the sum of its two sides is greater than the third
 side. Means if a, b, c are three sides of a triangle. Then the triangle
 is valid if all these three conditions are satisfied:

a + b > c
a + c > b
b + c > a
a = float(input("Enter side a: "))
b = float(input("Enter side b: "))
c = float(input("Enter side c: "))
if a + b > c and b + c > a and c + a > b:
    print("Triangle is valid.")
else:
    print("Triangle is Invalid.")    


Enter side a: 1
Enter side b: 2
Enter side c: 3
Triangle is Invalid
