Write a program that accepts the marks in 3 subjects of a student, 
calculates the average mark of the student and prints the student's 
grade. If the average mark is greater than or equal to 90, then the 
grade is 'A'. If the average mark is 80 and between 80 and 90, then the 
grade is 'B'. If the average mark is 70 and between 70 and 80, then the 
grade is 'C'. If the average mark is 60 and between 60 and 70, then the 
grade is 'D'. If the average mark is 50 and between 50 and 60, then the 
grade is 'E'. If the average mark is less than 50, then the grade is 
'F'.


mark1 = float(input("Enter the mark in the first subject: "))
mark2 = float(input("Enter the mark in the second subject: "))
mark3 = float(input("Enter the mark in the third subject: "))

average_mark = (mark1 + mark2 + mark3) / 3


if average_mark >= 90:
   grade = 'A'
elif average_mark >= 80:
   grade = 'B'
elif average_mark >= 70:
   grade = 'C'
elif average_mark >= 60:
   grade = 'D'
elif average_mark >= 50:
   grade = 'E'
else:
   grade = 'F'

print("The average mark of the student is", average_mark)
print("The grade of the student is", grade)

output:
Enter the mark in the first subject: 55
Enter the mark in the second subject: 66
Enter the mark in the third subject: 77
The average mark of the student is 66.0
The grade of the student is D
