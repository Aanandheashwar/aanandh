Write a program in python to calculate and print the Electricity bill where the 
unit consumed by the user is given from test case. It prints the total 
amount the customer has to pay. The charges are as follows:


def calculate_electricity_bill(units_consumed):
   if units_consumed <= 100:
      return units_consumed * 0.5
   elif units_consumed <= 200:

output:
Enter the number of units consumed: 100
Total Electricity Bill: $ 200.0
