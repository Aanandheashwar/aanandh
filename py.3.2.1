Determine whether a rectangle can be formed by giving the four sides. Such 
that length of its sides are a, b, c and d (in any order).

a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))
c = float(input("Enter the length of the third side: "))
d = float(input("Enter the length of the fourth side: "))


sides = [a, b, c, d]
sides.sort()


if sides[0] == sides[2] and sides[1] == sides[3]:
   print("The given sides can form a rectangle.")
else:
   print("The given sides cannot form a rectangle.")

   output:
Enter the length of the first side: 13
Enter the length of the second side: 14
Enter the length of the third side: 15
Enter the length of the fourth side: 16
The given sides cannot form a rectangle.
