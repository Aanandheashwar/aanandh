Given n time in hours, Write a program to find the time in minute at which the minute hand and hour hand coincide in next one hour.


hours = int(input("Enter the current hours: "))
minutes = int(input("Enter the current minutes: "))

angle_hour = (hours % 12) * 30 + minutes * (360/60) / 12

angle_minute = minutes * (360/60)


diff = 30 * (hours % 12) + 30 - 3 * minutes

minutes_to_coincide = (360 - diff) // 3

print("The minute and hour hands will coincide at", minutes_to_coincide, "minutes past", hours % 12)

output:
Enter the current hours: 3
Enter the current minutes: 45
The minute and hour hands will coincide at 125 minutes past 3
