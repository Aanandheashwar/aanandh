write a python program to find all the integers between n and m (inclusive) that are divisible by 9, and calculate their sum.

def find_divisible_by_9_and_sum(n, m):
    divisible_by_9 = [i for i in range(n, m+1) if i % 9 == 0]
    total_sum = sum(divisible_by_9)
    
    return divisible_by_9, total_sum
n = int(input("Enter the value for n: "))
m = int(input("Enter the value for m: "))

divisible_numbers, total_sum = find_divisible_by_9_and_sum(n, m)

print(f"Numbers divisible by 9 between {n} and {m}: {divisible_numbers}")
print(f"Sum of these numbers: {total_sum}")
